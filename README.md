# Pet-Store
This project uses a RESTful API to log pet store locations, employees, and customers into a database.
The pet store table includes the name, address, and phone number for each store. The stores will also have an auto-generated ID number.
The employee table includes a first and last name, a phone number, the pet store ID number, and an auto-generated employee ID number.
Similarly to the last tables, the customer table includes the customer's first and last names, their email, and an auto-generated ID number.
